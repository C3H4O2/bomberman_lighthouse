How to build a map
------------------

You can set the players starting points with the characters 1 and 2,
representing player one (1, wasd) and player two (2, arrow-keys).

Use the X symbol (capitalised) too place an indestructable object (white box).
Use the B symbol (capitalised) too place a destructable object (brown box).
A simple space indicates a empty spot, the game will leave it free.

The game won't check if your map works, so check if your map leaves enough room
for the players to move around in and at least one path from one player to the
other with at most destructable boxes in the way if you want to be able to play
the map.

Note: This file can be used as a template to build a map. The game only reads the
      first 7 lines and only their first 23 characters. The extension does not
      matter, you just have to give the proper path as an argument on start.
      Characters that are not listed here will be ignored.
